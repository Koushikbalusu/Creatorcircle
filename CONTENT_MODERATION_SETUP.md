# 🛡️ Content Moderation System Setup Guide

## 📋 Overview

This comprehensive content moderation system protects your student networking app from inappropriate content by:

- **Real-time text filtering** with 200+ inappropriate keywords
- **Image/video content analysis** using Google Cloud Vision API
- **Automatic email alerts** to admin when inappropriate content is detected
- **User blocking** with clear error messages
- **Storage-level protection** with Firebase Storage rules

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Enable Required Firebase APIs

In your Google Cloud Console, enable these APIs:

# Navigate to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library
# Enable the following APIs:
- Cloud Vision API
- Cloud Functions for Firebase  
- Cloud Natural Language API

```

### 2. Configure Email Settings

Set up your email password in Firebase Functions config:

```bash
# In your Firebase project directory
firebase functions:config:set email.password="YOUR_APP_PASSWORD"

# Note: Use App Password, not your regular Gmail password
# Generate App Password: Google Account > Security > 2-Step Verification > App passwords
```

### 3. Deploy Cloud Functions

```bash
cd creatorcircle123/functions
npm install
npm run build
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### 4. Update Firebase Storage Rules

```bash
# Deploy the updated storage rules
firebase deploy --only storage
```

### 5. Test the System

The content moderation will automatically activate when students try to post content.
